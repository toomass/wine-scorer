# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a blind wine tasting scoring system where judges can evaluate wines across multiple criteria without knowing the wine's identity. The system presents wines with anonymous IDs while maintaining category information, allowing for fair and unbiased evaluation across multiple scoring factors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wine judge, I want to see a list of wines to taste, so that I can systematically evaluate each wine in the tasting session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the judge opens the tasting session THEN the system SHALL display a list of wines with anonymous IDs
2. WHEN displaying wines THEN the system SHALL show the wine category but NOT the wine name or producer
3. WHEN displaying the wine list THEN the system SHALL support configurable quantities (e.g., 8 wines)
4. WHEN a wine is selected THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed scoring interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wine judge, I want to rate wines on multiple criteria, so that I can provide comprehensive evaluations across different aspects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the judge selects a wine THEN the system SHALL display scoring interface with multiple rating factors
2. WHEN rating factors are displayed THEN the system SHALL include color, mouthfeel, and aroma as configurable criteria
3. WHEN the judge rates a criterion THEN the system SHALL accept and store the score
4. WHEN all criteria are rated THEN the system SHALL allow the judge to save the complete evaluation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a wine judge, I want to navigate between wines easily, so that I can efficiently complete the entire tasting session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a wine's scoring interface THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to return to the wine list
2. WHEN on the wine list THEN the system SHALL indicate which wines have been scored and which remain
3. WHEN a wine has been partially scored THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing scores
4. WHEN returning to a previously scored wine THEN the system SHALL display the existing scores for editing
5. WHEN a wine has been fully scored THEN the system SHALL allow the judge to modify any individual criterion score
6. WHEN scores are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately update the total score

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a wine judge, I want to see calculated total scores for each wine, so that I can compare wines objectively based on my evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual criteria are scored THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate and display the total score
2. WHEN viewing the wine list THEN the system SHALL display the total score for each scored wine
3. WHEN all criteria have scores THEN the system SHALL show the complete total prominently
4. WHEN scores are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate and update the total

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a wine judge, I want visual feedback on my scoring progress, so that I can track my evaluation progress throughout the session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the wine list THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between unscored, partially scored, and fully scored wines
2. WHEN a wine is fully scored THEN the system SHALL display a completion indicator
3. WHEN the judge completes all wines THEN the system SHALL provide session completion feedback
4. WHEN viewing individual wine scores THEN the system SHALL display current ratings clearly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a tasting organizer, I want to configure the wine list and scoring criteria, so that I can customize the system for different tasting events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a tasting session THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of wine quantity
2. WHEN configuring wines THEN the system SHALL accept wine category information while maintaining anonymity
3. WHEN setting up scoring THEN the system SHALL allow customization of rating criteria beyond the default set
4. WHEN wines are configured THEN the system SHALL generate anonymous IDs that don't reveal wine identity
